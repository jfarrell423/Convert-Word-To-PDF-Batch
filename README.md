You can just open Word document in Ms Word and save as PDF. 
But what if you have tons of Word files to convert into PDF?

Just use this bat example and use it to convert a whole folder of 
Word Documents. Microsoft Word needs to be installed on the device.
For Ms Word 2010 and above, this feature is already available. 
However, for Ms Word 2007 or lower, you need to install 
“Microsoft Save as PDF or XPS” plugin.

This Batch file is using cscript.exe which is part of our modern windows 
environment under windows/system32. You will need to add to your environment 
system path .\ to run the script from your current working directory. 

You can open a command prompt (****run as administrator) and cd to the 
working directory. I would test a few files and see how it works. 

I created a PDF from a Word Document I created from the original article
found in a Google Search.
